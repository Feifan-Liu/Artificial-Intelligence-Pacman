# Artificial-Intelligence-Pacman
An AI Pacman solver

# Project 1
Designed pacman agent that find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. Implemented general search algorithms(BFS,DFS,UCS,A*) and applied them to Pacman scenarios.

# Project 2
Designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Implemented both minimax and expectimax search and evaluation function design.

# Project 3
Implemented value iteration and Q-learning. Tested the agents on Gridworld and applied them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.
